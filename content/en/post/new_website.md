Now that you're here, let's talk about the elephant ~~in the room~~ on the internet: this website.  

First off, you can see it's currently sort of barren.  That's because it's only a few days old, and it hasn't had a lot to say so far.  The content that _is_ here will be in quite a bit of flux for the next few weeks, as we get it to where we want it to be.  

We expect that to change over time. We are going to publish (through `CC-BY*` ) as much material as it makes sense to publish.  There are plans to lay out, code to write, and worlds to conquer.  There are opinions to opine and editorials to...editorial?  Edit?  Whatever.

Second, you may or may not like [the theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke).  We understand.  We're still a little ambivalent about it, as well.  It does seem to get the job done, but it is not very...pretty.  We are considering some sort of hackathon or competition or something for producing a new theme, but at the moment all the functionality that we need at this stage is present.

Third, please read and comment.  Currently, comments are in Disqus, and we may move to Commento (to make privacy more private), but engagement with the content here is on the list of things that would make us happy.  We hope you find value here.  Tell us what you like, what you don't like, and what you would like to see.  

Finally, we are going to ask you to contribute.  Soon, we will provide instructions for how to submit content.  This will be open strictly to BASE members, but we hope it will provide a place to capture the thoughts of our enthusiasts for a long time to come.
