BASE is first and foremost a community.  Our goals are to grow and educate this community, and to have fun doing it.  One of the ways we do this is through events such as "All Your BASE".  

All Your BASE is a [usually] monthly gathering of BASE members and friends to meet face-to-face to socialize, share ideas, and interact.  There is no agenda, no speakers, and no presentations.  Just come, hang out, and have fun.  The location varies, but is often at a local restaurant or bar.  Food and drinks are on you, but the conversation is on us!
