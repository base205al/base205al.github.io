Our [first All Your Base](./ayb20260129) at the Beer Hog was quite successful, so we're doing it again in February! 

Join us on Thursday, February 26th at 6:00 PM at [the Beer Hog in Pelham](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x5sue4wvsD2P5iVY7) for the second [All Your BASE](../about/#all-your-base) of 2026 to talk about whatever you're interested in!  We'll grab a table and hang out for a while.  

This time, we should have a sign unless Scooter eats it again. Sorry, Willy!  Hope to see you there!
