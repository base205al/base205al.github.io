As we wind down from Sloss.Tech, we’re excited to keep the momentum going with our next community [Show and Tell](../about/#show-and-tell) - July 1 at [Innovation Depot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jNXUaNXy8EMLcheC7).

Every month, developers from across Birmingham come together to share what they’ve been building, learn from each other, and build connections. Whether you’re working on a side project, launching something new, or just curious to see what others are up to, you’re welcome here.

Bring a project for a quick 3–5 minute talk, or just come and spectate. Live demos are encouraged (and broken demos are always cheered).

Let us know you're coming on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/base205/events/308159117)
