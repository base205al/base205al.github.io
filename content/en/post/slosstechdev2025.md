We ran a conference!

OK.  We ran a *track* at a conference.  But that conference was [sloss.tech](https://sloss.tech/) and it's kind of a big deal.  

BASE ran a development and engineering track called sloss.tech/dev at the McWane Center.  Finally, sloss.tech had actual tech at the conference!

We had a great time, and we hope you did, too!  Thanks to everyone who attended, spoke, and helped make the event a success.  We'd especially like to thank the McWane Center for hosting us and the Sloss.Tech team for organizing such a fantastic event.
