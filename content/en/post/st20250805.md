It's definitely hot outside!  Come cool off with us at our August [Show and Tell](../events/show_and_tell).  This time we will be hosted at the [Motion Industries Learning and Development Center](https://www.motion.com/cms/learning-and-development) on August 5.  The center is located at [1581 Alton Ct, Birmingham, AL 35210](H82Q+84 Birmingham, Alabama) and Motion Industries has graciously provided us with lunch as well as a space to meet and share our projects.

This month's event is going to be hosted by [Joe Jewell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-jewell-88376b141/).  Make sure you say "Hi!" and thank him for hosting us.


If you're not familiar with our format, the [Show and Tell](../events/show_and_tell) is a monthly gathering where developers from across Birmingham come together to share what they’ve been building, learn from each other, and build connections. Whether you’re working on a side project, launching something new, or just curious to see what others are up to, you’re welcome here.

Bring a project for a quick 5-10 minute talk, or just come and spectate. 

As always, live demos are encouraged and only broken demos get applause!

Let us know you're coming on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/base205/events/308691567)
