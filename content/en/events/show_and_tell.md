The BASE community has a lot of offer, and we want everyone to be able to experience it!

Every month, BASE sponsors a Show and Tell session where our enthusiasts bring what they are working on and spend 5 minutes showing it to the rest of us. 

This all started when Chris Winslett posted a chat in Magic City Tech's slack team.

> The goal here is to kick-start the developer meetup scene in Birmingham a little -- bring people together to show what they've been building + show what others are building. Looking to share knowledge and build some connections. Come and give a quick 3-5 minute presentation about what you've been building, then watch what others are building. Live demos are encouraged -- broken demos are cheered.

We've had a number of Show and Tell meetups and they've been well-received.  People have demonstrated tools and projects.  They have described theoretical systems and asked for input.  They have demo'd (far too successfully, if we're being honest).  

We get new attendees and returning folks every time.  Come be one of them!

## The Rules For Showing
You are the presenter?  The rules are pretty simple.  

- Bring something you're interested in showing to other people to the meetup and show it to them.  You'll get at least 5 minutes, depending on how may people are presenting, and possibly longer.
- Do a demo, if it can be demo'd.  If your demo fails, you will get applause.  
- There might be questions.  Stunned silence is also a possibility.
- If you want feedback, ask for it.

## The Rules for Being Shown To

You're watching a presentation?

- Be respectful.  Someone is taking time to show you something.  It may not be relevant to you, and you may not be able to provide feedback.  
- Be constructive.  If you're going to comment on all the work you didn't do, make that comment useful.  Add to the work.

## The Schedule

This meetup is generally scheduled for the first Tuesday of every month.
